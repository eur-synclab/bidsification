    "# Turning PAR/REC data into BIDS format using bidsify\n",
    "#### written by Eduard Klapwijk (https://github.com/eduardklap), with input from Philip Brandner, Suzanne van de Groep, Myrna van den Berg \n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use this notebook\n",
    "This notebook can be used to convert data with PAR/REC images (MRI image format generated by Philips scanners) into BIDS. The first step of this notebook will show you how to structure your data into pseudoBIDS format. After this, we use the bidsify tool (https://github.com/NILAB-UvA/bidsify) created by Lukas Snoek to convert the pseudoBIDS data into BIDS. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Shoutout to bidsify, Neurohackademy, and the BIDS community\n",
    "All kudos should go to the bidsify creators, this is just a guide that allows the usage of bidsify with an interactive notebook. When turning my own data (Eduard) into BIDS I got great help at Neurohackademy 2019 (https://neurohackademy.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on BIDS visit https://bids.neuroimaging.io and read the Gorgolewski et al. paper about the BIDS format here: https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.44\n",
    "Another useful resource is the BIDS starter kit: https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-starter-kit\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other useful BIDS tools\n",
    "There are multiple tools out there to convert datasets into Nifti (one of the main ones being Heudiconv: https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv). We use bidsify because this is as far as I am aware the only converter capable of working with PAR/REC files. Edit May 2020: I recently found out about BIDScoin (https://github.com/Donders-Institute/bidscoin), that should also be able to convert PAR/REC into BIDS."

    "Our situation:\n",
    "We have a longitudinal dataset with 3 timepoints (T1, T2, T3). For every timepoint we have participant folders with scans in par/rec format. The filenames contain the participant ID, and a number for the scan sequence (but because sometimes scans are restarted this number is not always the same for a particular sequence). It looks something like this:"
